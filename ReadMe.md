Paragraph How Im Feeling Today: I feel great today. I am happy because I dont have work today. I am enjoying working on my assignments. I am glad that I am healthy and able to have a wonderful life. I had my favorite food for lunch its called Pozole its a Mexican soup. So far its been a good day. I hope I have time to ride my bike later.
